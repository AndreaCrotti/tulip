* SCHEDULE
** abstract machine
*** TODO scope swapping & shadowing
class implementation is done, just need to figure out where and when to swap
it's probably better to do this in dispatch and uncomment dispatch.py:23 rather than managing context in the rules themselves
*** TODO rules
the machine rules are completely unimplemented

* NOTES
** abstract machine
*** bindings
- there are no cases where tags need to be bound
- figuring out where to start shadowing is easy, but where to stop is not
- scopes also need to be deleted sometime, but we may need the process model to do that reliably -- dunno really i'm pretty sleepy
