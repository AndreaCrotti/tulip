** abstract machine
*** bindings
- there are no cases where tags need to be bound
- scopes also need to be deleted sometime, but we may need the process model to do that reliably -- dunno really i'm pretty sleepy
- lets in blocks are bound sequentially (NOT EARLY)
- jneen wants lambda to introduce a new scope, which makes sense but might require reworking the symbol tables
- she also wants new scopes for each case alternative, motivated by her planned translation of pattern matching
